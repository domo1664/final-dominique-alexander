				<img src="dayday.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>DayDay:</span> He is the main character. You can jump on heads of any animal that crawls except the crab. He is the hero of this game coming to save the day and release his brother from captivity. He shoots fire balls but there is no double jump. This game is supposed to be realistic. Fireballs are up for interpretation but double jump is ridiculous. Where is this extra force of upward momentum coming from I'm not buying it. Our beloved hero can swim and shoot fireballs underwater too because thats how you swim like a boss. Each fireball takes one life from an enemy character and the amount of lives vary from different levels and charcters. If you don't know already this character can not double.">

				<img src="jayjay.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>JayJay:</span> He is our damsel in destress. I know Damsel is usually used as a term for women but it started out as a term for both so I'm going with it. JayJay can do every thing his brother can do, and no he cannot double jump. He runs slightly faster than his brother and is used for speed runs, if you have an hour to burn. Also his animation looks way cooler because you get to see his hair flap in the wind. Like a boss!">

				<img src="fireBlue.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Blue Fire Ball:</span> This is used to defeat all enemies from a distance. It has a one shot kill on all enemies in the first three levels except the ghost and the Hood Zombie. We'll get to them later.">

				<img src="fireRed.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Red Fire Ball:</span>This fire ball is used in levels four to six. Giving our hero a one shot kill on all sea creatures except the swordfish, shark, and octogoblin.">

				<img src="fireGold.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Blue Fire Ball:</span> The latest and greatest fireball is used for levels seven to nine. It has the same one shot kill on all enemies except the tokyo zombie and the Gui wang ">

				<img src="itemBox.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Mystery Box:</span> This is a magical box from the land of America. It generates random items each time you use it. The items consist of an extra life beacause... why not, and a perk which makes you invincible for three seconds. Be careful there are times when the mystery box is in a mood and generates no item at all. Who knows why.">

				<img src="box_0.png" class="navPic" alt="<span>Wooden Box:</span> This box does absolutely nothing. Its in the game to make the obstacles unique and progressively difficult. You cannot break or walk pass these boxes, they are as sturdy as a rock.">

				<img src="brick_0.png" class="navPic" alt="<span>Brick:</span> This is nothing like the wooden box at all. This brick when you jump into it from underneath it is destructable. Wait... There's more. Each brick has random amounts of money from 500 to 1000. That doesn't mean you can just smash bricks and beat the game. No no no. There are time where a brick has no reward at all. Also the brick makes up parts of the obstacle course so destroy each brick carefully and with a strategy.">

				<img src="china_brick_0.png" class="navPic" alt="<span>Tokyo Brick:</span>
				This is exactly the same as the original brick. This brick when you jump into it from underneath it is destructable. Each brick has random amounts of money from 500 to 1000. That doesn't mean you can just smash bricks and beat the game. No no no. There are times where a brick has no reward at all. Also the brick makes up parts of the obstacle course so destroy each brick carefully and with a strategy.">

				<img src="cash.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Scrilla A.K.A {Money}:</span> This is the money in the game which has no real value other than paying for JayJay's ransom. This is one of the special parts of the game. Its the only thing that can be saved through out each gameplay.">

				<img src="heart.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Life:</span> This needs no introduction. One heart is a life and getting hit by any enemy decreases your life by one. The heart can only be gained through the mystery box so don't pass any on your way through out the game.">

				<img src="perk.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Perk:</span> This is a pill. I know pills are bad and people tend to abuse them but in this game its good. Use the pill as much as you can it makes you invincible for three seconds. This comes in handy when you have enemies that chase you, like the sharks, birds, and fish.">

				<img src="pigeon.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Pigeon:</span> This pesky little thing is extremely annoying if you don't develop a solid strategy for their annihilation. They can be killed with one fireball but they chase you and throw you off your game and be very afraind if two are three are close by. The bird is the only enemy that flies and our hero can jump on its head. Every other enemy that chases you can not be jumped on. Keep that in mind, when you get to ocean levels.">

				<img src="coon.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Racoon:</span> This isn't as pestering as the bird but they have an sly way to them. They move so slow you think they are harmless until you lose a life or three. You can kill the racoon two ways with a fire ball and jumping on its head.">

				<img src="pig.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Pig:</span> The pig and the racoon are similar in a way. You can jump on it's head and shoot it with your fire fists. Moreover, they also possess that sneaky quality which allows them to go undetected because they don't chase you. But be careful about jumping down off ledges because you have a hord oe enemies freely roaming or chasing you.">

				<img src="snake.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Snake:</span> The name says it all. They're sneaky, you can jump on their heads or give them that fire. But don't get too comfortable or they'll snap at your heels.">

				<img src="fish.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Blue Fish:</span> I love this fish because it reminds me of dory from that movie I might not be legally allowed to mention. They swim quick and attack even faster don't let there pretty colors fool you they are vicous. And if they get to close give them that fire. Or run but you get no cool points for running. So stay cool and give dory that fire.">

				<img src="jellyfish.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Jellyfish:</span> Oh man! These guys are ferocious their long tentacles have a massive reach so you have to bob and weave. yes! they can die from fireballs too. Word of advice either become ghost from power or get your michael phelps on. In other words kill the jellyfish.">

				<img src="crab.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Crab:</span> These guys are amazing the scavengers of the sea. Unfortunately these crabs cannot be eaten. Beware how close you get to them beacuse you can't jump on their heads. So be safe and put a fire ball between you and the crab.">

				<img src="swordfish.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Swordfish:</span> This is where the game starts to get interesting. So this enemy needs more than one fire ball to kill it, I'll let the number be a surprise. It's only right you die on the fifth level and start from the beginning. Keep a fire ball on you and don't be scared to use them.">

				<img src="shark.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Shark:</span> This enemy like the sword fish requires multiple fire balls for it to meet the red death. To keep it interesting the shark was made slightly faster than the swordfish. So let your fist rain fire balls like a hail storm of burning marshmallows.">

				<img src="panda.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Panda:</span>There are no enemies in Atlanta but these guy's can be found in the tokyo levels.they are slow and easy to kill your welcome. These guys are in the game because I needed enemies and I couldn't make the final levels so hard it was impossible to beat. So here's to having fun playing hood bros.">

				<img src="ninja.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Ninja:</span> These ninja's are employees of the chinese mafia and will throw as many throwing stars it takes to keep you way from the Gui Wang. He is the gate keeper to your brother's freedom and defeating him means getting a brother back.">

				<img src="zombieCity.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Hood Zombie:</span> These are the zombies that can be found in all poverty stricken neighborhoods a.k.a the ghetto. They are fast when they want to be and requires way more fire balls than the average enemy. How many fire ball's can kill them? Thats up to you to find out. If you survive to tell the story. Beware some zombies are walkers and some are runners.">

				<img src="zombieTokyo.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Tokyo Zombie:</span>This is a cool zombie. It walks to you. No real rush to kill it unless your overloaded with a cluster...bomb of enemies. So enjoy the little break these slow zombie allow you to take. Don't get too comfy each level has a wrench to throw you off. Keep your eyes open young grass hopper.">

				<img src="cityBoss.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Ghost:</span> Just like in real life our biggest enemy is our not so perfect past. So here come a ghost to stalk you and take your lives as you think he's there for aesthetics or decoration. Yes he's an enemy. Or she. Females can be ghost's too. Also you cannot jump on its head.">

				<img src="oceanBoss.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Octogoblin: Its an octopus mixed with a goblin. That has to scare some people like why is this ugly octopus chasing me. i guess i'll just light it up with fire balls. you are correct if that was your train of thought. Fire ball's are the only way to kill this sea creature.</span>">

				<img src="tokyoBoss.gif" class="navPic" alt="<span>Gui Wang:</span> The most powerful boss in the game. The gate keeper, the el capitan, the don dadda. It takes a lot of fire balls to take this thing out. So get a nice run and shoot strategy down before even trying because you will fail. So like always let the fire balls rain on that bootleg bed spread wearing ghost.">

				<img src="door_0.png" class="navPic" alt="<span>Door:</span> These doors can lead to two places, the sub level or the next level. The first door you see in the level will lead to the sub level and the second door in any level is what takes you to the next level. So all in all its levels to this ish. So get it right and keep a fire ball between you and all sucker enemies out there looking to snatch a heart. Keep your hearts safe and play wisely. I don't play games often but when I do I play hood bros.">
