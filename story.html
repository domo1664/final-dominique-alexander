					Hood Bros is a tale of two brothers DayDay and JayJay trying to survive the mean streets on New York City. In the midst of scratching and surviving JayJay gets kidnapped by the Chinese Mafia. I know you wondering why the Chinese Mafia. Its serious you can't make this stuff up. JayJay was kidnapped by the Chinese Mafia because he had black market diamonds and his fence {middle man} told another employer of JayJay's treasure. Needless to say, JayJay hid his treasure giving the Mafia no choice but to kidnap him for the ransom of $10,000,000. DayDay knowing his skill in shooting fireballs already knows he's prepared for any challenge and will take on any monster, ghost, ghoul, or goblin. In his search for his kidnapped brother, DayDay comes across racoons, birds, snakes, pigs, hood zombies, tokyo zombies, pandas, jellyfish, crabs, swordfish, sharks, ghost, and a octogoblin {cross breed of octopus and goblin}. DayDay is constantly rewarded for his progress with power ups and extra lives to make this journey's end reasonable to reach.
					There are nine main levels and nine sub levels. The main levels are filled with obstacles, while the sub levels have less obstacles but don't get too comfortable in the sub levels.The length of the gameplay last a little over an hour and each pixel was crafted with<span style="display:inline;">&#10084;</span>. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I did creating it. Thanks for reading this far.
